/**
 * Method ordering based on code similarity. Methods are selected one after
 * another and, whenever a method has previously been picked, the logic checks
 * whether there is a remaining method that shares many similar instruction
 * (sub)sequences and has few differing instruction (sub)sequences. When
 * there is no next similar method that stands out, the orderer reverts back to
 * the original method order.
 *
 * In other words, we only change the original method order by lumping together
 * highly similar methods. For example, methods with a small body like "return
 * true;" would all get co-located right after the first such method, resulting
 * in better compression.
